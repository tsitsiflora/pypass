## about

Weak passwords can be defined as short, those that use only alphanumeric characters or one that is "obvious". When a password is obvious it means it's easy to remember for that person, but also easy to decrypt for an attacker.People often use obvious passwords such as the names of their children or their house number in order not to forget them. However, the simpler the password, the easier to detect. Because people tend to create "obvious" passwords more, I created pypass, a program that returns a list of passwords based on the target information.

pypass is a password compiler, written in Python. It accepts input about the target from the user and returns possible passwords in a .txt file. Password lists are custom made, based on the information the user provides. This caters for passwords that include native language words. pypass can be used when performing password cracking(ethically) using the dictionary attack.
